The numbers 3, 6, 9, and 72 are multiples
of 3(but not 5), so print Fizz on those
lines.

(but not 3), so print Buzz on those lines.
The number 75is a multiple of both 3and
5, so print FizzBuzz on that line.

None of the other values is a multiple of
either 3 or 5, so print the value of jon
those lines.
